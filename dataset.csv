"5","Student[11]","[11]","What are the main advantages associated with object-oriented programming?","To sumulate the behaviour of portions of the desired software product.","Coding and Debugging programs are usually easier, as either the compiler will specify the object that is working incorrectly, or the function an object was assigned to will be easier to identify.  The code itself also looks more organized and is easier to read and will help to avoid redundant coding.  Post-programming maintenance is also easier.Also, modules can be reused several times in other programs without too much hassle.
